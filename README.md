# Nitpicking
This is an on-going project that proves all open-source obfuscators suck, even my own.

## Summaries

- ``Recommend`` column describes how likely I would recommend this project to be used in production environment, in four categories:
    - To a Great Extent
    - Somewhat
    - Very Little
    - Not at All

| Project | Recommend | Summary |
| ------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Pluto | Very Little | The author is obviously an InfoSec expert, but probably treated this project as a hobby project so not much time is spent on it. As a result, the implementation is full of small hiccups that may or may not trigger catastrophic results in production |
| Hikari-LLVM15 | To a Great Extent | Most of the important changes are done by @NeHyci , who actually cares about the project's quality and has spent a great amount of effort to improve the crappy code quality of the OG Hikari | 

## Contributing
In order to conitrbute, make an entry in the Summaries section with all of the pertinent information and create a respective folder. That folder should have enough detail to give a good idea of how that obfuscator works. You should provide an evaluation of the relevant information , similar to Pluto's analysis. Include a link to the obfuscator.
Try to limit contributions to more well-known obfuscators, as reviews of lesser-known obfuscators aren't as useful since those are less-likely to be used. Try to provide constructive criticism, if any, in case the contributors read this project for feedback. 

Low effort additions will be removed.
