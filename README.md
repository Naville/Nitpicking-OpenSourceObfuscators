# Nitpicking
This is an on-going project that proves all open-source obfuscators suck, even my own.

## Summaries

- ``Recommend`` column describes how likely I would recommend this project to be used in production environment, in four categories:
    - To a Great Extent
    - Somewhat
    - Very Little
    - Not at All

| Project | Recommend | One Line Description |
| ------- | --- | -------------------- |
| Pluto | Very Little | The author is obviously an InfoSec expert, but obviously treated this project as a hobby project so not much time is spent on it |
| Hikari-LLVM15 | To a Great Extent | Most of the important changes are done by @NeHyci , who actually cares about the project's quality, unlike me |
